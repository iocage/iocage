## A FreeBSD jail manager

iocage is a jail/container manager amalgamating some of the best features and
technologies the FreeBSD operating system has to offer. It is geared for ease
 of use with a simple and easy to understand command syntax.

iocage is in the FreeBSD ports tree as sysutils/py-iocage.
To install using binary packages, simply run: `pkg install py36-iocage`

## Installation

### GitHub:

The FreeBSD source tree ***must*** be located at `$SRC_BASE` (`/usr/src` by default) to build from git.

- `pkg install python36 git-lite libgit2 cython3 py36-pip`
- `git clone --recursive https://github.com/iocage/iocage`
- `make install` as root

To install subsequent updates: run `make install` as root.

### Ports:

- Build the port as follows: `cd /usr/ports/sysutils/iocage/ ; make install clean`

### Pkg:

- It is possible to install pre-built packages using pkg(8) if you are using FreeBSD 10 or above: `pkg install py36-iocage`

#### Upgrading from `iocage_legacy`:

This repository replaces `iocage_legacy`. To upgrade to the current version:

1. Stop the jails (`service iocage stop; iocage stop ALL`)
1. Back up your data
1. Remove the old `iocage` package if it is installed (`pkg delete iocage`)
1. Install `iocage` using one of the methods above
1. Migrate the jails. This can be done by running `iocage list` as root
1. Start the jails (`service iocage onestart`)

## WARNING:

- This is beta quality software, there be dragons! Please report them.
- Some features of the previous iocage_legacy are either being dropped or simply not ported yet, feel free to open an issue asking about your favorite feature. But please search before opening a new one. PR's welcome for any feature you want!

## Raising an issue:

We _like_ issues! If you are having trouble with `iocage` please open a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/iocage/iocage/issues) and we will ~~run around with our hair on fire~~ look into it. Before doing so, please give us some information about the situation:

- Tell us what version of FreeBSD you are using with something like `uname -ro`
- It would also be helpful if you gave us the output of `iocage --version`
- Most importantly, try to be detailed. Simply stating "I tried consoling into a jail and it broke" will not help us very much.
- Use the [Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#code-formatting) GitHub page for more information on how to paste lines of code and terminal output.

## Submitting a pull request:

Please be detailed on the exact use case of your change and a short demo of
it. Make sure it conforms with PEP-8 and that you supply a test with it if
relevant. Lines may not be longer then 80 characters.

## FEATURES

- Ease of use
- Rapid jail creation within seconds
- Automatic package installation
- Virtual networking stacks (vnet)
- Shared IP based jails (non vnet)
- Transparent ZFS snapshot management
- Export and import
- And many more!

## QUICK HOWTO

Activate a zpool:

`iocage activate ZPOOL`

*NOTE: ZPOOL is a placeholder. Use `zpool list` and substitute it for the
zpool you wish to use.*

Fetch a release:

`iocage fetch`

Create a jail:

`iocage create -n myjail ip4_addr="em0|192.168.1.10/24" -r 11.0-RELEASE`

*NOTE: em0 and 11.0-RELEASE are placeholders. Please replace them with your
real interface (`ifconfig`) and RELEASE chosen during `iocage fetch`.*

Start the jail:

`iocage start myjail`

Congratulations, you have created your first jail with iocage!
You can now use it like you would a real system.
Since SSH won't be available by default, `iocage console myjail` is a useful
spot to begin configuration of your jail.

To see a list of commands available to you now, type `iocage` outside the jail.

### REQUIREMENTS

- FreeBSD 9.3-RELEASE amd64 and higher or HardenedBSD/TrueOS
- ZFS file system
- Python 3.6+
- UTF-8 locale (place into your ~/.login_conf):

```plain
me:\
        :charset=UTF-8:\
        :lang=en_US.UTF-8:\
        :setenv=LC_COLLATE=C:
```

### Optional

- Kernel compiled with:

        # This is optional and only needed if you need VNET

        options         VIMAGE # VNET/Vimage support

### Helpful Considerations

- For the explanations on jail properties read jail(8)
- Create bridge0 and bridge1 interfaces for VNET jails to attach to.
- Use `iocage set` to modify properties and `iocage get` to retrieve property
 values
- Type `iocage COMMAND --help` to see any flags the command supports and their help, for example:

        iocage create --help
        iocage fetch --help
        iocage list --help
- If using VNET consider adding the following to `/etc/sysctl.conf` on the host:

        net.inet.ip.forwarding=1       # Enable IP forwarding between interfaces
        net.link.bridge.pfil_onlyip=0  # Only pass IP packets when pfil is enabled
        net.link.bridge.pfil_bridge=0  # Packet filter on the bridge interface
        net.link.bridge.pfil_member=0  # Packet filter on the member interface
- Lots of jails or a big server? Mount `fdescfs`:

        mount -t fdescfs null /dev/fd
