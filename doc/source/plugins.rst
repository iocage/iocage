Plugins
=======

iocage plugins are a simple and very fast method to get application
containers installed and configured. At its core, a plugin is a jail
specifically running one program. Popular programs can be installed
repeatedly with one line. Additionally, plugins are easily extended by
users, offering a high level of customizability and functionality.

In structure, a plugin consists of :file:`.json` manifest and
:file:`.png` icon files.


**See what's available**


To see a list of all currently available plugins, open a command line
and type :command:`iocage list -PR` or
:command:`iocage list --plugins --remote`. The full
`iocage plugin list <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freenas/iocage-ix-plugins/master/INDEX>`_
is also available on GitHub.

Check which plugins are installed on the system with
:command:`iocage list --plugins` or :command:`iocage list -P`.


**Getting started with plugins**


.. note:: iocage needs to be `activated <Activate iocage>`_ before
   plugins can be installed or modified!


To get started, open a command line and type
:command:`iocage fetch --plugins ip4_addr="IF|IP"`. This initial
:command:`fetch` also supports *dhcp* in the same manner as
:command:`iocage create`. The IP listed for the plugin needs to
be a valid IP not already in use. Use the *- -name* flag to easily fetch a
specific plugin:

:samp:`$ iocage fetch --plugins --name plexmediaserver ip4_addr="igb0|192.168.0.91"`

If available, plugins can also be fetched locally with
:command:`iocage fetch -P the/path/to/plugin.json ip4_addr="re0|192.168.0.100"`


.. tip:: Using :command:`iocage fetch` locally is very useful when
   testing an in-development plugin.


After fetching a plugin, view of all its properties with
:command:`iocage get -a NAME|UUID | less`. Individual properties are
found with :command:`iocage get PROPERTY`:

:samp:`$ iocage get type quasselcore`

Adjust the plugin properties with :command:`iocage set`:

:samp:`$ iocage set PROPERTY quasselcore`


:command:`iocage set` is used to configure
that plugin. In this example, a complete Quasselcore plugin is
installed to a FreeNAS system, then the note of the plugin is changed:

.. code-block:: none

    [root@freenas ~]# iocage fetch --plugins --name quasselcore ip4_addr="em0|192.168.1.50"
    [root@freenas ~]# iocage set notes="Hello world" quasselcore
    [root@freenas ~]# iocage get notes quasselcore
    Hello world


**Upgrading and updating plugins**


The process for upgrading and updating plugins is exactly the same as
normal jails. See :ref:`Updating Jails` or :ref:`Upgrading Jails` .


**Plugin Manifest Example**


Following is an example of a plugin manifest:

.. sourcecode:: json

    {
        "name": "default_jail_name_here",
        "release": "11.3-RELEASE",
        "artifact": "https://github.com/git_path_to_plugin_repo",
        "official": false,
        "properties": {
            "nat": 1,
            "nat_forwards": "tcp(7878:7878)"
        },
        "devfs_ruleset": {
            "paths": {"bpf*": null},
            "includes": []
        },
        "pkgs": [
        ],
        "packagesite": "http://pkg.FreeBSD.org/${ABI}/latest",
        "fingerprints": {
            "iocage-plugins": [
                {
                    "function": "sha256",
                    "fingerprint": "b0170035af3acc5f3f3ae1859dc717101b4e6c1d0a794ad554928ca0cbb2f438"
                }
            ]
        },
        "revision": "0"
    }

* **devfs_ruleset**: It should be a valid dictionary object where "paths" must be specified. Value of "paths" is a
  dictionary where keys are the path to be added and the value is the mode to be used. `null` translates to `unhide`.
  For any include specified, please refer to the following example which shows how each path specified is added as
  iocage dynamically generates a devfs ruleset and how an include is added to the ruleset:

.. sourcecode:: shell

    devfs rule -s ruleset_number add path bpf* unhide
    devfs rule -s ruleset_number add include include_value
