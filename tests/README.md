##### iocage must be installed for the tests to function

# Code testing
All the tests are written using the `pytest` unit testing framework. Code coverage is provided by `pytest-cov`

Before running tests, test dependencies can be installed by running:
```
$ pip3.6 install pytest-cov pytest-pep8 pytest-mock
```

## Unit tests

Located in the ``tests/unit_tests`` directory, they can be started as a normal user with the following command:

```
$ pytest
```

## Functional tests

Located in the ``tests/functional_tests``, they need a root access and the name of a ZFS pool

**/!\ The contents of the specified ZFS pool will be destroyed**

To start the functional tests, run pytest with root privileges and the name of a zpool:
```
$ sudo pytest --zpool=mypool
```

Other parameters are available, to see them run:
```
$ pytest --fixtures
```
Extract:
```
zpool 
    Specify a zpool to use.
release 
    Specify a RELEASE to use.
server 
    FTP server to login to.
user 
    The user to use for fetching.
password
